# Contributing to AR-Vocab-App

Thank you for considering contributing! This document explains how to report issues, request features, and submit changes.

Before you start
- Check existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplication.
- If you plan a large feature, open an issue first to discuss scope and design.

How to contribute
1. Fork the repository (if you don't have push access).
2. Create a branch for your work:
   - Feature: `feat/<short-description>`
   - Bugfix: `fix/<issue-number>-<short-description>`
3. Make your changes in the branch. Keep changes focused and small when possible.
4. Run tests and linters (if available) and ensure the project still builds.
5. Commit with clear messages (consider Conventional Commits).
6. Push your branch and open a Pull Request describing:
   - What you changed and why
   - Any related issues (link them)
   - How to test the change

Branching & commit guidelines
- Use short, descriptive branch names and PR titles.
- Make atomic commits that make review easier.
- Squash or rebase before merging if requested by maintainers.

Issues (how to open a useful one)
Include the following when relevant:
- Title: short and descriptive
- Description: what’s happening and why it is a problem or improvement
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Environment: device, OS, versions
- Attach screenshots, logs, or video if available
- Suggest labels (bug, enhancement, docs) if possible

Coding standards & tests
- Follow language/framework style guides (formatting, naming).
- Add unit tests for non-trivial logic when possible.
- Avoid committing secrets or credentials.
- Avoid committing large binaries; use Git LFS for large assets (models, textures).

Review process
- Keep PRs small and focused for faster review.
- Be respectful in discussions and respond to feedback.
- Maintainers may request changes — please update the PR promptly.
- If a PR becomes inactive, it may be closed after a notice.

Good first issues
If you want a starter task, look for issues labeled `good first issue` or open an issue asking for a small task to begin.

Community & Code of Conduct
Please follow a friendly, respectful behavior. If you'd like, we can add a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file (recommended).

Thanks!
Contributions make this project better. If you want, tell me which tech stack you use and I will:
